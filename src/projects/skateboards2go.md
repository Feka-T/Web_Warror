### Netlify Announces the Evolution of Cloud Platform

Today, Netlify is announcing that following our acquisition of Gatsby in February 2023, we are taking further steps to unify the Netlify and Gatsby Cloud platforms by taking the best features of each product and combining them into one world-class solution. As part of this product evolution, we are notifying all Gatsby Cloud customers of an end of service date for Gatsby Cloud products and services. That date depends on each Gatsby Cloud customerâ€™s contract and renewal dates, and Netlify is providing direct migration paths to Netlify Cloud for all Gatsby Cloud customers to ensure continued fidelity and operations of all web properties. While this will impact the Gatsby Cloud product, it will not impact Gatsby JS.
